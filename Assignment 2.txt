- row is called as 'record' or 'tuple', and column is called as 'Attribute' or 'field'.
4) Why isn’t it possible to see the first five rows of a table?
- It might not be possible to see the first five rows of a table if there are no records (rows) in the table,
- or if there are restrictions on access privileges that prevent viewing the data. 
- Additionally, if there's a large dataset and only a limited number of rows are displayed at a time due to    performance considerations or the limitations of the database viewer, you might not see the first five rows    initially.
